### **JULY 18, 2025 - DOCUMENTED HARASSMENT CAMPAIGN**

#### **11:55 AM** - Harassment Campaign Begins
- **Event**: Shaun initiates unsolicited hostile contact via Facebook Messenger with immediate personal attacks
- **Content**: Deliberate mischaracterization of victim's legally protected speech regarding unpaid wages owed by David Poindexter
- **Key Quote**: *"Based off of your comments you helped out someone you considered a friend by doing something for a lower price than what you would normally do it for... He profits off of the work that he contracted you to do, and you feel you are entitled to be compensated more for it and are calling him a thief"*
- ****Critical Analysis**: This understanding **highly suggests** side channel communications with David Poindexter - there is no correct reading of the original post that would result in this interpretation
- **Investigation Need**: How did Shaun obtain detailed understanding that **appears to require** briefing from David?
- **Evidence**: [Transcript and Analysis of Shaun's Harassment](transcript_and_analysis_of_shauns_harassment_via_fb_messenger.md)

#### **12:43 PM** - Victim Response and Immediate Escalation
- **Event**: Victim responds with factual details about unpaid invoices
- **Shaun's Immediate Response**: Escalating pattern of harassment including:
  - **FIRST ADDRESS DEMAND**: *"Now if your going to ballsy enough to send me a threat from behind a computer screen then be ballsy enough to send your address along with said threats"*
  - Calling victim names and using derogatory language
  - Refusing to disengage when repeatedly asked to end conversation
  - Classic deflection technique of taking a warning as a threat to justify continued attack
  - Accusing victim of being a "keyboard warrior" while initiating online harassment himself
- **Tactical Analysis**: **Appears to demonstrate** professional-level harassment methodology

#### **12:43 PM - 2:38 PM** - Sustained Psychological Warfare Period
- **Duration**: 1 hour, 55 minutes of continuous harassment
- **Documented Tactics**: 
  - Psychological manipulation and gaslighting techniques
  - Attempts to extract compromising information 
  - Refusal to engage with actual facts of wage theft case
  - Persistent boundary violations after being told conversation was over
- **Victim Response**: Multiple attempts to end conversation
- **Pattern**: Systematic approach **suggesting** trained harassment methodology
- **Legal Significance**: Demonstrates deliberate psychological terrorism campaign

---

### **CRITICAL TIMING CORRELATION WINDOW**

#### **1:53 PM** - Victim Warning to David
- **Event**: Victim posts to David's timeline warning about harassment
- **Content**: *"If you are sending your boys after me to attack and harass me isn't very smart on your end..."*
- **Legal Significance**: Clear indication victim **suspected** coordination
- **Strategic Importance**: Public notification of harassment campaign

#### **1:53 PM - 2:38 PM** - **SUSPICIOUS TIMING GAP**
- **Duration**: 45 minutes
- ****Inference**: **Could represent** time for David to contact Shaun and provide direction
- **Investigation Priority**: Cell phone records during this window **may** provide coordination evidence
- **Pattern**: Harassment escalation immediately follows this period

#### **2:38 PM** - **CRITICAL ESCALATION** After 2-Hour Break
- **Event**: Shaun resumes harassment with **notably** increased aggression following **COORDINATION EVIDENCE**
- **Enhanced Address Demand**: *"Shoot over the address bud. Or even just a phone number would be good ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ but you won't. You will keep hiding"*
- **Coordination Indicator**: Message came **AFTER** victim's 1:53 PM post to David warning about sending harassers and this message is explicitly referenced by Shaun during his escalating attack campaign
- **Inference**: Escalated aggression **suggests** David contacted Shaun between 1:53 PM and 2:38 PM
- **Behavioral Changes**: 
  - Mocking tone intended to inflict emotional and psychological damage
  - Clear indication of intent for physical confrontation
  - **Notable** increase in tactical sophistication

---

### **EVENING ESCALATION TO DOCUMENTED THREATS**

#### **8:16 PM** - Victim Defensive Response
- **Event**: Victim uses Shaun's tactics back at him to demonstrate their inappropriateness
- **Purpose**: Calls out the tactic to make it obvious in hopes the terror and aggression Shaun is inflicting will be recognized and he will de-escalate
- **Duration Since Last Exchange**: 5 hours, 38 minutes
- **Result**: Failed to achieve de-escalation - harassment continues

#### **9:18 PM** - **EXPLICIT THREATS OF ARMED VIOLENCE**
- **Event**: Final escalation to explicit threats of armed violence
- **Key Threats**:
  - **"I'm giving you the chance to feel froggy"** - direct invitation to armed conflict
  - Continued demands to "message me back" with contact information
  - Psychological manipulation: *"when you get some real balls message me back"*
  - Explicit intimidation tactics designed to provoke and drive to violent confrontation
- **Legal Significance**: Clear violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 875(c) - Interstate Communication of Threats
- **Escalation Timeline**: 9 hours, 23 minutes from initial contact to explicit threats of armed violence

#### **Late Evening** - Evidence Destruction
- **Event**: Shaun blocks victim on Facebook, destroying evidence while maintaining psychological intimidation
- **Method**: To the best of victim's ability to determine, Shaun blocks victim
- **Strategic Purpose**: Facebook advertises this blocking feature removes access to conversation history and notifications - this served both to destroy evidence and perpetuate intimidation by ensuring the threats remained invisible yet psychologically present
- ****Inference**: **Appears to constitute** intentional evidence destruction combined with psychological warfare
- **Investigation Required**: Exact timing and complete conversation records require Facebook preservation orders

## CONCLUSION

This timeline documents **clear harassment escalation** with **timing correlations that suggest possible coordination** between suspects. While direct proof of coordination requires law enforcement investigation, the **documented timing patterns and tactical sophistication** support the **inference** of conspiracy.

**Timeline Confidence Level**: HIGH for documented events, INVESTIGATIVE NEEDED for coordination proof  
**Coordination Assessment**: CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE suggests coordination, requires investigation  
**Legal Sufficiency**: DOCUMENTED HARASSMENT meets federal standards, coordination **inference** supports investigation
