"Did you buy those ingredients with the money you never paid me thief? When it isn't your money does it taste better? I will never stop contacting the businesses you do business with and warn them about you. NEVER. I hope it was worth it thief."

"See David you might be wondering why now? Why have I started to contact all of your clients I can find. To be honest it is because I have been way too angry with you and your wage theft. 

But the thing that really set me off was when you called me foaming at the mouth mad tearing into me for not being able to make a trash product work over a weekend.

For the record all my work was GOLD but the crappy system I was coding for changed and broke things... You knew this, but you acted like that anyhow. Worse to try to get the time in I spent $300 of my own money at a hotel as the travel would have prevented the work...  and this is work you profited off of as you kept sharing the numbers with me... 

Your unbound arrogance, greed, and ego.. it took all of that to act as you did as you owed me money for work unpaid... you demanded even more unpaid work. I guess that is the type of abuse that makes a CEO eh?

This was hourly contractual work by the way MANY of your clients are very happy with... you did this to the person that literally saved your business after you fucked up and lost all of your backups. I even did so much free not billed work for you thief... 

So when you stole that money from me and kept it I walked away from you and your evil actions. I figured you were desperate since you asked me to work sans pay while you get things in line then started acting like a tyrant... typical super desperate behavior... then I find out you have a massive expansion and a second location. 

Wow, can you imagine the anger? 

Well I don't like operating out of anger. I wanted to operate rationally and make sure people know about you and are not turned off by my tone. 

When I say never... I mean never. 

I will perform a public service to let everyone know that you are a wage thief and profit off stolen work. 

I want you to feel the pain and anger I felt, but I'll never get that. Instead I will do my public duty an warn others about your duplicity. If it is the last thing I do I will make you regret hurting me like that. You hurt me and my family in ways you will never own up to with your BS. So I will just be happy to know that the opportunity cost exposing your actions will cause will cost you more than you ever stole from me. I'll never see real justice but this... this I can do a few times a year no problem and not dive back into my rage at you. 

I hope you get better at life, I considered you a good friend at one point and time."
