# AMENDMENT WORKFLOW DOCUMENTATION
## File Organization & Version Control System

**Created:** July 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Document proper workflow for managing filing amendments and version control

---

## CORE PRINCIPLES

### 1. DUAL TRACKING SYSTEM
- **Git:** Technical version control for developers/technical users
- **Folders:** Point-in-time amendments for lawyers/filing/printing

### 2. MAIN BRANCH PRESERVATION
- **Main branch = Original filing state**
- Never modify original documents in main branch
- Maintains historical integrity of initial filing
- Provides baseline for comparison

### 3. AMENDMENT FOLDERS = POINT-IN-TIME FILINGS
- Each amendment folder = Complete filing package ready for submission
- Self-contained with all necessary documents and evidence
- Version-stamped for legal filing requirements
- Print-ready organization for legal professionals

## WORKFLOW PROCEDURES

### FOR NEW AMENDMENTS

1. **Create New Amendment Folder**
   ```bash
   mkdir Amendment_[N]_Filing_Package
   ```

2. **Copy Enhanced Files from Previous Amendment**
   ```bash
   cp -r Amendment_1_Filing_Package/* Amendment_2_Filing_Package/
   ```

3. **Make Incremental Changes**
   - Only modify files that need updates
   - Document all changes in FILING_MANIFEST.md
   - Update version numbers and dates

4. **Git Branch for Technical Tracking**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b amendment-2-additional-evidence
   git add Amendment_[N]_Filing_Package/
   git commit -m "Amendment 2: Additional evidence and developments"
   ```

5. **Preserve Main Branch Integrity**
   - Never modify main branch files
   - Main branch remains original filing state
   - All changes go to amendment folders only

### FOR FILING/SUBMISSION

1. **Use Latest Amendment Folder**
   - Amendment folder = complete filing package
   - Print directly from amendment folder
   - Submit using FILING_MANIFEST.md as guide

2. **Version Documentation**
   - Each amendment has date stamps
   - FILING_MANIFEST.md tracks all changes
   - Git commits provide technical audit trail
