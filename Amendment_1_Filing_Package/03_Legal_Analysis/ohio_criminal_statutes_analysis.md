#### Evidence Supporting Application:
- **Pattern of Conduct:** Approximately 9.5-hour sustained harassment campaign via Facebook Messenger
- **Mental Distress:** Documented medical evidence of stress-induced health effects (gout, hives)
- **Reasonable Belief of Harm:** Explicit demands for home address combined with threatening language
- **Interstate Nature:** North Carolina resident targeting Ohio resident
- **Ohio Employment History:** Suspect's LinkedIn profile shows previous Ohio employment, indicating local knowledge and potential ongoing contacts

- **Behavioral Impact Evidence:** Police body camera testimony documenting victim's fear, sleep disruption, hypervigilance, security system installation, and life disruption
- **Collusion-Enhanced Fear:** Evidence of coordinated harassment amplifies victim's reasonable belief that threats are part of organized campaign with multiple actors
- **Intentional Evidence Destruction:** Suspect blocked victim to eliminate conversation history and prevent response

#### Felony Enhancement Elements Present:
- **Direct Threats Made:** "Feel froggy" statement constitutes threat of physical harm
- **Escalating Pattern:** Harassment intensified over time with increasing aggression

### 2. TELECOMMUNICATIONS HARASSMENT (ORC § 2917.21)

**Core Requirements:** Use of telecommunications to abuse, threaten, or harass

- **Purpose to Harass:** Sustained campaign with no legitimate communication purpose
- **Threatening Content:** Multiple threatening statements and demands for personal information
- **Internet Web Posting:** Statute specifically covers social media communications
- **Modern Technology Application:** Ohio courts recognize Facebook Messenger as telecommunications under this statute

- **Business Connection:** Suspect's association with targeted company CEO David Poindexter
- **Strategic Selection:** Suspect likely chosen for Ohio employment history and local area familiarity
- **Operational Effectiveness:** Ohio connections provide suspect with enhanced surveillance and threat capabilities
- **Retaliatory Nature:** Clear connection between protected speech and subsequent harassment
- **Apparent Collusion Evidence:** Coordinated timing and targeted selection suggest broader conspiracy beyond individual harassment

### 3. AGGRAVATED MENACING (ORC § 2903.21)

**Core Requirement:** Threats of serious physical harm

#### Evidence Supporting Application:
- **"Feel Froggy" Statement:** Ohio case law recognizes coded threats of armed violence

- **Enhanced Threat Capability:** Previous Ohio employment suggests ongoing contacts who could facilitate locating victim
- **Escalating Threats:** Pattern shows increasing severity over harassment campaign
- **Context of Violence:** Threatening language used in conjunction with demands for victim's location

#### Distinguishing from Simple Menacing:

## VICTIM IMPACT CONSIDERATIONS

### Medical Documentation
- Stress-induced health effects documented
- Physical manifestations of harassment (gout, hives)
- Medical evidence supports serious harm claims

### Heightened Fear Due to Ohio Connections
- **Geographic Vulnerability:** Suspect's Ohio employment history creates reasonable fear of ongoing surveillance capability
- **Local Network Access:** Previous Ohio employment suggests current contacts who could provide victim's address through social engineering
- **Professional Network Exploitation:** Potential access to business directories, professional associations, and local contacts
- **Coordinated Network Fear:** Evidence of collusion suggests multiple actors with varying capabilities and local connections
- **Immediate Protective Need:** Ohio connections transform theoretical threat into imminent danger requiring urgent law enforcement intervention

### Documented Fear Response & Behavioral Changes
- **Police Body Camera Testimony:** Victim provided documented testimony to law enforcement regarding ongoing fear and threat assessment
- **Sleep Disruption:** Victim no longer uses normal sleep aids (Spotify on TV) to remain alert for potential threats
- **Hypervigilance:** Actively listening for "bumps in the night" due to heightened security concerns
- **Physical Security Measures:** Installing rear security camera system in direct response to threats
- **Life Disruption:** Missing children's cross country pre-training due to preoccupation with security concerns
- **Contrary to Initial Assessment:** Officer's initial dismissive views contradicted by extensive documented evidence of real fear and harassment impact

### Additional Emotional Distress from Law Enforcement Response
- **Case Dismissal Without Review:** Initial law enforcement response dismissed case without apparent thorough examination of evidence
- **Institutional Abandonment Fear:** Victim's fear intensified by perception that authorities would not take threats seriously
- **Collusion Concern Amplification:** Dismissive law enforcement response raised fears of broader conspiracy potentially involving institutional actors
- **Compounded Vulnerability:** Dismissive response increased victim's sense of isolation and defenselessness against ongoing threats
- **Network Protection Fear:** Concern that coordinated harassment campaign might extend influence into law enforcement or judicial systems
- **Secondary Victimization:** Law enforcement's failure to properly investigate added additional emotional trauma beyond original harassment
- **Systemic Fear:** Concern that criminal justice system would not provide protection heightened overall anxiety and distress

### Economic Impact

- Professional reputation damage
- Costs of protective measures
- Security system installation and monitoring expenses
