## COMPLAINT TYPE
☑ Police Misconduct  
☑ Disability Discrimination  
☑ Pattern or Practice Violation (34 U.S.C. § 12601)

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I am respectfully filing this civil rights complaint regarding concerns about the Pataskala Police Department's practices that may violate federal civil rights laws. This complaint documents concerning patterns including:

1. **Concerns about different treatment** for connected individuals versus other victims
2. **Possible ADA violations** through failure to accommodate autism-related behaviors  
3. **Unequal investigation standards** that may be based on victim characteristics
4. **Potential civil rights concerns** under federal law (42 U.S.C. § 1983)
5. **Local oversight limitations** - Licking County Sheriff's Office declined jurisdiction, leaving only the problematic Pataskala Police Department as local option

## PATTERN OR PRACTICE EVIDENCE

### INCIDENT 1: VIOLENT ASSAULT COVER-UP
**Date:** [Previous incident]  
**Complainant:** [COMPLAINANT_FULL_NAME] (autism spectrum disorder)  
**Perpetrator:** Roommate whose brother is Pataskala police officer  

**Facts:**
- Discovered roommate stealing via fraud (75/25 utility split manipulation)
- During confrontation about theft, roommate became violent
- Roommate swung at me; I restrained him defensively
- 200lb mastiff attacked, chewing on my arm while I was trapped in hallway
- Roommate repeatedly punched my head while dog attacked
- Threatened to shoot me, demanded I leave residence
- Called police to report assault and battery

**Police Response:**
- Officers interviewed perpetrator on porch "laughing it up" entire time
- Never contacted victim for statement or follow-up
- No charges filed despite clear assault evidence
- No complaint processed or investigation conducted
- **Pattern Element:** Protection of officer's family member

### INCIDENT 2: INTERSTATE HARASSMENT DISMISSAL  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Complainant:** [COMPLAINANT_FULL_NAME] (autism spectrum disorder)  
**Perpetrators:** Shaun Strange (NC) and David Poindexter (NC) - coordination evidence

**Facts:**
- Comprehensive evidence package of interstate stalking/harassment
- Approximately 9.5 hours of documented threats and intimidation
- Demands for home address with "feel froggy" armed violence threats
- Medical evidence of stress-induced physical harm
- Cryptographically verified digital evidence
- Police body camera testimony documenting victim fear

**Police Response:**
- Dismissed case without reading evidence package
- Blamed victim for "showing strength" during harassment
- Claimed defensive behavior indicated "no fear" - legally incorrect standard
- Failed to investigate Ohio state crimes within their jurisdiction or refer interstate elements to federal authorities
- No investigation despite clear Ohio state violations within their jurisdiction
- **Pattern Element:** Discriminatory investigation standards

## ADA VIOLATIONS (42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.)

### DISABILITY: AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER

**Documented Autism-Related Behaviors Mischaracterized:**

1. **Mirroring Communication:** When harasser demanded my address, I responded "you first coward" - well-documented autism coping mechanism to demonstrate social inappropriateness, used by individuals with ASD to navigate social situations and process information
2. **Direct Communication Style:** Straightforward, logical responses characteristic of autism
3. **Systematic Documentation:** Detail-oriented evidence preservation typical of autism
4. **Defensive Responses:** Logical, proportional reactions to threats
5. **Language Imprecision:** Autism-related communication differences in labeling and phrasing (section labeled "REFUSAL TO ENGAGE:" weaponized by officers)

### REQUIRED ADA ACCOMMODATIONS DENIED

**Title II Requirements Violated:**
- **Reasonable modifications:** Police must accommodate disability-related behaviors
- **Equal access:** Same investigation standards regardless of neurotype  
- **Communication accommodation:** Understanding autism communication differences
- **Non-discrimination:** Cannot criminalize disability-related responses

**Police Failures:**
- Interpreted autism defensive behaviors as "aggressive"
- Applied neurotypical behavioral expectations discriminatorily
- Failed to recognize mirroring as autism coping mechanism
- **Failed objective complaint review:** Officer twisted my analysis section labeled "REFUSAL TO ENGAGE:" (describing perpetrator's refusal to engage honestly) into false claim that I wanted engagement to continue
- **Disqualifying misinterpretation:** Any reasonable reading shows I was analyzing harasser's dishonest behavior, not expressing desire for continued harassment
- **Became adversarial rather than investigative:** Officer's approach suggested goal was to end engagement rather than conduct proper investigation
- Denied equal protection based on disability characteristics

## CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS

### 42 U.S.C. § 1983 - SECTION 1983 CLAIMS
**Color of Law Violations:**
- Police acting under governmental authority
- Deprived constitutional rights to equal protection
- Due process violations through bias-based investigations
- Discriminatory enforcement of laws

### 34 U.S.C. § 12601 - PATTERN OR PRACTICE
**Systematic Misconduct Elements:**
- **Regular practice:** Two documented incidents showing consistent bias
- **Policy of discrimination:** Protecting connected individuals, discriminating against victims with disabilities
- **Not isolated incidents:** Pattern spans multiple years and cases

### 18 U.S.C. § 242 - CRIMINAL CIVIL RIGHTS  
**Willful Rights Deprivation:**
- Knowing violation of clearly established rights
- Acting with deliberate indifference to constitutional violations
- Pattern of discriminatory law enforcement

## DISCRIMINATORY IMPACT ANALYSIS

### PROTECTED CLASS: INDIVIDUALS WITH DISABILITIES
**Disparate Treatment Evidence:**
- Neurotypical victims would not have defensive behaviors mischaracterized
- Police applied different standards based on autism-related responses
- Accommodation requests denied, creating discriminatory barrier to equal justice

### COMMUNITY IMPACT
**Pattern Affects:**
- Individuals with disabilities seeking police protection
- Crime victims with family/personal connections to officers
- Interstate crime victims requiring federal law enforcement cooperation

1. **Federal Investigation** of Pataskala Police Department pattern or practice
2. **Detective Assignment** to properly investigate interstate harassment case  
3. **ADA Compliance Review** of department policies and training
4. **Civil Rights Monitoring** of future investigations

### SYSTEMIC REFORMS
1. **Policy Changes:** Eliminate discriminatory investigation standards
2. **Training Requirements:** ADA compliance and disability accommodation training
3. **Oversight Mechanisms:** Federal monitoring of investigations involving disabilities
4. **Accountability Measures:** Consequences for discriminatory practices

### INDIVIDUAL REMEDIES

    - **REQUEST INCLUDES:** All evidence regardless of timeframe - these times provided to help isolate required evidence
- Digital forensic evidence of interstate crimes

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION BASIS

**Interstate Commerce:** Crimes crossed state lines (NC to OH)  
**Civil Rights Enforcement:** Local police bias necessitates federal oversight  
**ADA Enforcement:** Federal law requiring accommodation compliance  
**Pattern/Practice Authority:** DOJ jurisdiction over systematic police misconduct

## CONCLUSION

The Pataskala Police Department has demonstrated a clear **pattern or practice of discrimination** that violates federal civil rights laws. This systematic misconduct includes protecting connected individuals, discriminating against individuals with disabilities, and applying unequal investigation standards based on victim characteristics.

Federal intervention is necessary to:
- Ensure equal justice under law for all citizens
- Protect civil rights of individuals with disabilities  
- Address systemic police misconduct requiring pattern/practice reform
- Investigate serious interstate crimes with appropriate federal coordination

## WHAT I REALLY WANT

I just want this to end peacefully. If Shaun apologizes and explains why he did this, I'm willing to resolve this. But I need to know:

1. **Who else was involved?** I suspect David Ponidexter may have put him up to this
2. **Will he leave me alone?** I need his promise that he won't retaliate against me or my website nvisionativesucks.com that exposes David's CEO misconduct

**Important:** I never intended any violence whatsoever. I take great offense at any suggestion otherwise. My responses were defensive - showing him how inappropriate his behavior was by mirroring it back. This response came from fear, not aggression.

**Personal Statement on Autism Discrimination:** I know what is in my heart. My entire life I have suffered discrimination and ill will due to my autism - reactions to my approach to communicating, assumptions of ill intent, and attacks when people feel threatened because I ask questions I am genuinely curious about but which expose ignorance and embarrass others. I have little social awareness of many of my actions and have suffered greatly in my life due to lack of understanding around how I communicate. The police department is perpetuating this lifelong pattern of autism discrimination.

**Seeking Medical Documentation:** I am currently working through Ohio's disability services system to obtain formal autism diagnosis and documentation. My autism-related communication differences include direct questioning, literal interpretation, and difficulty reading social cues - all of which are well-documented, common characteristics of autism spectrum disorder according to medical literature and autism research organizations.

**ADA Legal Protections:** Under 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA Title II), public entities cannot discriminate based on disability and must make reasonable accommodations. My autism-related communication patterns deserve protection, yet the police department has violated these legal requirements by using my disability-related behaviors against me to dismiss my complaint and deny equal protection.

**Clarification on Misinterpretation:** If any of my posts or actions have been misconstrued as threatening when they were innocent acts, I am willing to discuss any such interpretations and apologize for my actions causing fear due to mischaracterization.

**The Problem:** Police discrimination prevents proper investigation, necessitating federal intervention to achieve justice. While the harassment incident has observably paused, the effects persist and accountability is required to prevent future incidents.

**Law Enforcement Connection Concerns:** The unexpected dismissive police response makes me believe this individual may be law enforcement as well, enhancing my fears even more. His undisclosed current employment on his LinkedIn heightens this possibility.

**URGENT:** Ongoing pattern of discrimination creates immediate danger to civil rights and public safety. Federal oversight is essential to prevent further constitutional violations.
