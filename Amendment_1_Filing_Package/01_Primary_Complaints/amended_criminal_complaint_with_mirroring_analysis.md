## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This federal criminal complaint bypasses local law enforcement due to demonstrated discrimination and formally requests:
1. **Federal investigation** of interstate stalking violations under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A
2. **Civil Rights Division intervention** for violations under 18 U.S.C. ยง 242 (Color of Law)
3. **ADA Title II enforcement** for disability accommodation failures
4. **DOJ Pattern/Practice investigation** under 34 U.S.C. ยง 12601 of Pataskala Police Department
5. **Federal prosecution** of interstate crimes and civil rights violations where evidence supports charges

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION BASIS & EVIDENCE ANALYSIS

### INTERSTATE STALKING ELEMENTS (18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A)

**Discriminatory Local Police Response:** Officers dismissed legitimate harassment claims based on discriminatory misunderstanding of victim's defensive responses, demonstrating bias that necessitates federal intervention.

**Legal Analysis:** The defensive mirroring response actually **STRENGTHENS** the federal stalking case through established legal principles under 18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A, contrary to local police discrimination:

#### 1. INTERSTATE STALKING INTENT EVIDENCE (18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A(2))

**Perpetrator's Demand:** "Shoot over the address bud. Or even just a phone number would be good ๐ ๐ ๐"

**Victim's Defensive Response:** "You first coward"

**Federal Legal Significance:**
- **Intent to harass/intimidate:** One-way address demand from stranger across state lines
- **Course of conduct:** Pattern of demands for personal information after threats
- **Reasonable fear standard:** Victim's defensive response demonstrates awareness of threat
- **Interstate commerce:** North Carolina resident demanding Ohio victim's location

#### 2. VICTIM FEAR EVIDENCE UNDER FEDERAL STANDARD

**Federal Legal Principle:** Defensive responses can coexist with genuine fear (United States v. Alkhabaz, 104 F.3d 1492)

**Supporting Evidence:**
- Perpetrator initiated address demands following threats of violence
- Victim's proportional defensive response demonstrates recognition of threat
- **Federal precedent:** Victims may show strength while experiencing reasonable fear
- **Additional fear factors:** Suspect's undisclosed current employment on LinkedIn profile, combined with unusual police dismissiveness, raises concerns about potential law enforcement connections enhancing victim's reasonable fear

#### 3. ESCALATION PATTERN EVIDENCE (18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A)

**Behavioral Analysis:** Innocent person would recognize inappropriate nature when behavior mirrored
**Perpetrator's Escalation:** Responded with "feel froggy" armed violence threats
**Federal Significance:** Escalation after defensive response demonstrates continuing course of conduct required for federal stalking charges

#### 4. VICTIM IMPACT EVIDENCE (18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A(2))

**Documented Victim Statement:** "See how it is when someone twist everything?"
- Demonstrates conscious awareness of harassment tactics
- Shows sophisticated understanding of manipulative behavior
- **Federal significance:** Victim awareness strengthens reasonable fear standard
- **Medical corroboration:** Stress-induced physical symptoms (gout, hives) support reasonable fear claim

## FEDERAL CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (18 U.S.C. ยง 242 & 34 U.S.C. ยง 12601)

### PATTERN OR PRACTICE EVIDENCE (34 U.S.C. ยง 12601)

#### Case 1: Previous Violent Crime Cover-Up
**Date:** [Prior incident]  
**Incident:** Roommate theft discovery led to violent assault by roommate and his 200lb mastiff
**Police Connection:** Assailant's brother was Pataskala police officer
**Outcome:** 
- Observed police appeared to have friendly interaction with assailant during interview
- No charges filed despite reported assault evidence
- Complaint was not processed
- Victim did not receive follow-up contact

**Trauma Impact:** The department's failure to protect me from this violent assault caused such terror that I moved from Ohio to Louisiana to escape further abuse without protection. I developed serious PTSD from these events. It took extraordinary strength and courage for me to seek help from the very same department that had failed to protect me before - knowing I had to return to the department that chose favoritism over my safety.

#### Case 2: Current Harassment Dismissal
**Date:** July 2025  
**Incident:** Interstate stalking/harassment with documented evidence
**Discriminatory Police Response:**
- Case dismissed despite comprehensive evidence package due to bias
- Mischaracterized victim's defensive responses as indicating "no fear" - legally incorrect and discriminatory
- Refused investigation of clear Ohio state crimes within their jurisdiction
- Failed to refer interstate elements to federal authorities - dereliction of duty
- **Pattern demonstrates systematic discrimination requiring federal intervention**

### PATTERN OF DISCRIMINATION ELEMENTS

**Federal Pattern/Practice Elements (34 U.S.C. ยง 12601):**
1. **Discriminatory law enforcement practices** - systematic different treatment of crime victims
2. **Constitutional violations** - denial of equal protection and due process rights
3. **Regular occurrence** - documented pattern across multiple incidents and timeframes  
4. **Departmental policy/custom** - institutional practices that violate federal civil rights laws

## FEDERAL DISABILITY RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (42 U.S.C. ยง 12132)

### FEDERAL ADA TITLE II VIOLATIONS (42 U.S.C. ยง 12132)

**Statutory Requirements:**
- Public entities **SHALL NOT** discriminate based on disability (mandatory language)
- **MUST** make reasonable modifications to avoid discrimination
- **MUST** distinguish disability-related behaviors from criminal conduct
- **CANNOT** criminalize actions resulting from disability
- **MUST** provide equal access to services and programs

### AUTISM-RELATED BEHAVIORS MISCHARACTERIZED

**My Defensive Behaviors:**
- **Mirroring technique:** Well-documented autism coping mechanism to demonstrate social inappropriateness - research confirms individuals with ASD use mirroring to navigate social situations, process information, and manage anxiety
- **Direct communication:** Autism-related straightforward response style
- **Logical analysis:** Systematic thinking approach typical of autism
- **Documentation focus:** Detail-oriented evidence preservation
- **Imprecise language:** Autism-related communication differences in labeling and phrasing

**Areas Where Understanding Could Be Improved:**
- My defensive autism behaviors were seen as "aggressive"
- There was a misunderstanding about my analysis section labeled "REFUSAL TO ENGAGE:" (describing perpetrator's refusal to engage honestly) which was interpreted as me wanting engagement to continue
- A clearer reading shows I was analyzing the harasser's dishonest behavior, not expressing desire for continued harassment  
- The officer's approach seemed focused on concluding the interview rather than investigating
- My mirroring behavior wasn't recognized as an autism communication strategy
- Neurotypical behavioral expectations were applied without considering my disability
- **ADA Concern:** My disability-related responses were used against me rather than accommodated

### FEDERAL ADA ACCOMMODATIONS DENIED (42 U.S.C. ยง 12132)

**Mandatory Accommodations Under Federal Law:**
1. **Communication accommodation:** Recognition of autism direct communication patterns (supported by medical literature)
2. **Behavioral accommodation:** Understanding defensive mirroring as documented autism coping mechanism (APA diagnostic criteria)
3. **Procedural accommodation:** Allowing systematic, evidence-based case presentation typical of autism processing
4. **Equal access:** Identical investigation standards regardless of neurological differences

## WHAT I REALLY WANT

I seek peaceful resolution of this matter. If Shaun provides a formal apology and explains his actions, I am willing to resolve this case. However, I require the following information:

1. **Full disclosure of any collusion:** Investigation into whether David Ponidexter coordinated or instigated these actions
2. **Assurance of no retaliation:** Written commitment that he will not take further action against me or my website nvisionativesucks.com that documents David's CEO misconduct

**Important:** I never intended any violence whatsoever. I take great offense at any suggestion otherwise. My responses were defensive - showing him how inappropriate his behavior was by mirroring it back. This response came from fear, not aggression.

**Personal Statement on Autism Discrimination:** I know what is in my heart. My entire life I have suffered discrimination and ill will due to my autism - reactions to my approach to communicating, assumptions of ill intent, and attacks when people feel threatened because I ask questions I am genuinely curious about but which expose ignorance and embarrass others. I have little social awareness of many of my actions and have suffered greatly in my life due to lack of understanding around how I communicate. The police department is perpetuating this lifelong pattern of autism discrimination.

**Seeking Medical Documentation:** I am currently working through Ohio's disability services system to obtain formal autism diagnosis and documentation. My autism-related communication differences include direct questioning, literal interpretation, and difficulty reading social cues - all of which are well-documented, common characteristics of autism spectrum disorder according to medical literature and autism research organizations.

**ADA Legal Protections:** Under 42 U.S.C. ยง 12132 (ADA Title II), public entities cannot discriminate based on disability and must make reasonable accommodations. My autism-related communication patterns deserve protection, yet the police department has violated these legal requirements by using my disability-related behaviors against me to dismiss my complaint and deny equal protection.

**Clarification on Misinterpretation:** If any of my posts or actions have been misconstrued as threatening when they were innocent acts, I am willing to discuss any such interpretations and apologize for my actions causing fear due to the mischaracterization.

**The Problem:** Local police discrimination prevents proper investigation, necessitating federal intervention to achieve justice. While the harassment incident has observably paused, the effects persist and accountability is required to prevent future incidents.

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION CONCLUSION

This case presents clear federal jurisdiction under multiple statutes:
- **18 U.S.C. ยง 2261A (Interstate Stalking):** Interstate commerce nexus with documented threats and demands for victim location
- **18 U.S.C. ยง 242 (Civil Rights - Criminal):** Willful deprivation of constitutional rights under color of law
- **42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (Civil Rights - Civil):** Constitutional violations by state actors
- **34 U.S.C. ยง 12601 (Pattern/Practice):** Systematic discriminatory law enforcement practices
- **42 U.S.C. ยง 12132 (ADA Title II):** Disability discrimination by public entity

**FEDERAL INTERVENTION REQUIRED:** Local law enforcement bias and constitutional violations necessitate federal investigation and prosecution to ensure equal justice under law and protect interstate commerce from criminal activity.
