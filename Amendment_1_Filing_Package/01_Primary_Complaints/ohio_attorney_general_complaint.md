### INCIDENT 2: CURRENT INTERSTATE HARASSMENT DISMISSAL
**Date:** July 2025  
**Location:** Pataskala, Ohio  
**Victim:** [COMPLAINANT_FULL_NAME] (individual with autism)

**Facts:**
- Comprehensive evidence package of interstate stalking/harassment
- North Carolina suspects making threats and demanding home address
- Medical evidence of stress-induced trauma
- Police body camera testimony documenting victim's fear and security concerns
- Clear Ohio state crimes requiring investigation within their jurisdiction

**Police Misconduct:**
- **Dismissed case without reading evidence** package
- **Blamed victim** for "showing strength" during harassment  
- **Mischaracterized autism behaviors** as indicating "no fear"
- **Failed to investigate Ohio state crimes** within their jurisdiction
- **Failed to accommodate disability** as required by law
- **Pattern:** Discriminatory investigation standards based on victim characteristics

## OHIO PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS VIOLATIONS

### OHIO REVISED CODE § 109.77 - CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS
**Professional Standards Violated:**
- **Failure to serve and protect:** Denied equal protection to crime victims
- **Discriminatory practices:** Applied different standards based on disability and connections
- **Bias-based policing:** Protected connected individuals while discriminating against others
- **Constitutional violations:** Violated equal protection and due process rights

### OHIO PEACE OFFICER TRAINING COMMISSION STANDARDS
**Training Requirements Ignored:**
- **Disability awareness:** Failed to accommodate autism-related behaviors
- **Federal law compliance:** Ignored interstate crime jurisdiction requirements  
- **Professional conduct:** Demonstrated bias and unprofessional behavior
- **Constitutional policing:** Violated fundamental equal protection principles

## DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION (ADA VIOLATIONS)

### OHIO REVISED CODE § 4112 - CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLIANCE
**State Disability Rights Violated:**
- **Equal access to services:** Denied equal police protection based on autism
- **Accommodation requirements:** Failed to accommodate autism-related communication differences
- **Non-discrimination:** Applied neurotypical behavioral expectations discriminatorily

### AUTISM-RELATED BEHAVIORS MISCHARACTERIZED
**Legitimate Autism Responses Criminalized:**
1. **Mirroring communication:** Used "you first coward" to demonstrate harasser's inappropriate behavior - well-documented autism coping mechanism used by individuals with ASD to navigate social situations, process information, and manage anxiety
2. **Direct communication:** Straightforward, logical responses typical of autism  
3. **Systematic documentation:** Detail-oriented evidence preservation characteristic of autism
4. **Defensive responses:** Proportional, logical reactions to genuine threats

**Police Discrimination:**
- Interpreted autism defensive behaviors as "lack of fear"
- Applied neurotypical behavioral expectations as investigation standard
- Failed to recognize autism communication patterns as legitimate
- **Failed objective complaint review:** Officer twisted my analysis section labeled "REFUSAL TO ENGAGE:" (describing perpetrator's refusal to engage honestly) into false claim that I wanted engagement to continue - any reasonable reading shows I was analyzing harasser's dishonest behavior, not expressing desire for continued harassment
- **Denied equal protection** based on disability characteristics

## PATTERN OF DEPARTMENTAL BIAS

### SYSTEMATIC DISCRIMINATION EVIDENCE
1. **Connected Individual Protection:** Consistent pattern of shielding officer family members from prosecution
2. **Victim Blaming:** Systematic approach of blaming victims rather than investigating crimes
3. **Disability Discrimination:** Pattern of applying different standards to individuals with disabilities
4. **Federal Law Disregard:** Consistent failure to recognize federal jurisdiction requirements

### COMMUNITY IMPACT

## WHAT I REALLY WANT

I just want this to end peacefully. If Shaun apologizes and explains why he did this, I'm willing to resolve this. But I need to know:

1. **Who else was involved?** I suspect David Ponidexter may have put him up to this
2. **Will he leave me alone?** I need his promise that he won't retaliate against me or my website nvisionativesucks.com that exposes David's CEO misconduct

**Important:** I never intended any violence whatsoever. I take great offense at any suggestion otherwise. My responses were defensive - showing him how inappropriate his behavior was by mirroring it back. This response came from fear, not aggression.

**Personal Statement on Autism Discrimination:** I know what is in my heart. My entire life I have suffered discrimination and ill will due to my autism - reactions to my approach to communicating, assumptions of ill intent, and attacks when people feel threatened because I ask questions I am genuinely curious about but which expose ignorance and embarrass others. I have little social awareness of many of my actions and have suffered greatly in my life due to lack of understanding around how I communicate. The police department is perpetuating this lifelong pattern of autism discrimination.

**Seeking Medical Documentation:** I am currently working through Ohio's disability services system to obtain formal autism diagnosis and documentation. My autism-related communication differences include direct questioning, literal interpretation, and difficulty reading social cues - all of which are well-documented, common characteristics of autism spectrum disorder according to medical literature and autism research organizations.

**ADA Legal Protections:** Under 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA Title II), public entities cannot discriminate based on disability and must make reasonable accommodations. My autism-related communication patterns deserve protection, yet the police department has violated these legal requirements by using my disability-related behaviors against me to dismiss my complaint and deny equal protection.

**Clarification on Misinterpretation:** If any of my posts or actions have been misconstrued as threatening when they were innocent acts, I am willing to discuss any such interpretations and apologize for my actions causing fear due to mischaracterization.

**The Problem:** Police discrimination prevents proper investigation, necessitating federal intervention to achieve justice. While the harassment incident has observably paused, the effects persist and accountability is required to prevent future incidents.

**Law Enforcement Connection Concerns:** The unexpected dismissive police response makes me believe this individual may be law enforcement as well, enhancing my fears even more. His undisclosed current employment on his LinkedIn heightens this possibility.

The documented pattern of protecting connected individuals while discriminating against victims with disabilities represents a fundamental failure of professional law enforcement standards requiring immediate state oversight and reform.
