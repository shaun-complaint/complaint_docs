# FORMAL CRIMINAL COMPLAINT
## Interstate Stalking, Harassment, and Criminal Conspiracy via Electronic Communications

**TO:** FBI Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3), U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of Ohio

**NOTE:** Licking County Sheriff's Office declined to accept this complaint, citing jurisdictional issues and referring the matter to Pataskala Police Department. Given Pataskala PD's demonstrated bias and failure to investigate, federal intervention is necessary.

**RE:** Interstate Criminal Stalking, Harassment, and Suspected Criminal Conspiracy - Shaun Strange (Iredell County, North Carolina) and David Poindexter (CEO, nvisonative.com, Iredell County, North Carolina)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I am filing this formal criminal complaint against Shaun Strange, a resident of Iredell County, North Carolina, for interstate stalking, harassment, and making threats via electronic communications in violation of federal and state laws. I am also requesting investigation of suspected criminal conspiracy with David Poindexter (CEO of nvisonative.com) to intimidate, harass, and silence my legally protected speech regarding wage theft.

on July 16, 2025, the suspect, Shaun (a North Carolina resident), initiated contact with me (an Ohio resident) via a Facebook friend request, which I accepted the next day on July 17, 2025.

 Later on July 18, 2025, Shaun began a sustained harassment campaign spanning approximately 9.5 hours (11:55 AM - 9:36 PM), escalating to demands for my home address and explicit threats of physical and armed violence. Critically, Shaun then blocked me, an intentional act that removed my access to conversation history and notifications. Facebook advertises this before you do it. This served both to destroy evidence and perpetuate intimidation by ensuring the threats remained invisible yet psychologically present.  

Evidence strongly suggests this is a coordinated attack aimed to silence my First Amendment-protected warnings to the business community regarding David Poindexter's pattern of wage theft and business fraud.

**QUANTIFIED LEGAL STANDARDS:**
- **Reasonable suspicion:** 42.1% certainty (Duke University Judicature study)
- **Probable cause:** 49.7% certainty (Duke University Judicature study)  
- **Beyond reasonable doubt:** 90.1% certainty (Duke University Judicature study)


This complaint seeks **immediate emergency law enforcement intervention to protect my family from imminent physical harm**, investigate the suspected conspiracy, and **remove all firearms from both suspects through applicable legal processes**. The explicit threats of armed violence ("feel froggy"), repeated demands for my home address, and evidence of coordination create an immediate danger requiring comprehensive firearm prohibition and removal procedures.

## FEDERAL CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS

### Interstate Stalking and Communications Crimes:

**1. Interstate Stalking (18 U.S.C. § 2261A(1))**
- Suspect used electronic communications to harass across state lines with intent to harass, intimidate, and place under surveillance
- Engaged in course of conduct causing substantial emotional distress
- Made implicit and explicit threats intended to intimidate and frighten

**2. Cyberstalking (18 U.S.C. § 2261A(2))**
- Used mail or facility of interstate commerce to engage in course of conduct placing person in reasonable fear of serious bodily injury
- Caused substantial emotional distress to victim and family
- Engaged in pattern of threatening behavior

**3. Interstate Communication of Threats (18 U.S.C. § 875(c))**
- Transmitted communications containing threats via interstate commerce
- "Feel froggy" comment constitutes a clear threat of armed violence
- Repeated demands for home address with threatening context

### Suspected Federal Conspiracy Crimes:

**4. General Conspiracy to Commit Federal Offenses (18 U.S.C. § 371)**
Evidence suggests agreement between David Poindexter and Shaun Strange to commit multiple federal offenses:

- **Conspiracy to Commit Interstate Stalking:** Agreement to harass across state lines with overt acts including Shaun's 10-hour harassment campaign
- **Conspiracy to Intimidate Witnesses:** Agreement to prevent victim from reporting wage theft crimes through coordinated harassment designed to discourage testimony and silence protected speech
- **Conspiracy to Transmit Interstate Threats:** Agreement to use interstate communications to threaten victim, with overt acts including "feel froggy" threats and address demands via Facebook's interstate servers

**Elements Satisfied:**
- **Agreement:** Circumstantial evidence of coordination between suspects
- **Overt Acts:** Shaun's harassment campaign, threat transmission, systematic intimidation
- **Federal Offense Object:** Interstate stalking, witness intimidation, and threat transmission

**5. Civil Rights Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. § 241)**
- Apparent conspiracy to deprive victim of First Amendment rights
- Apparent coordinated effort to silence protected commercial speech about business fraud
- Interstate nature and systematic targeting of constitutional rights

**6. Potential RICO Conspiracy (18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c), 1962(d)) - FOR INVESTIGATION**

**Potential RICO Enterprise Elements (requiring investigation):**
- **Potential Enterprise:** Business network coordination between suspects across state lines
- **Potential Predicate Acts:** Interstate harassment/stalking, extortion through threats, witness intimidation
- **Investigation Required:** Pattern of criminal activity using business resources to silence fraud witnesses
- **Note:** RICO charges require comprehensive investigation to establish enterprise and pattern elements beyond current evidence

### Federal Obstruction and Extortion Crimes:

**7. Witness Intimidation/Retaliation (18 U.S.C. § 1513)**
- Harassment designed to prevent victim from reporting crimes
- Intimidation to discourage testimony about wage theft
- Coordinated effort to silence potential witness

**8. Extortion by Threat (18 U.S.C. § 875(d))**
- Demands to cease protected speech backed by threats
- Interstate transmission of extortive communications
- Intent to control victim's behavior through intimidation

### Constitutional Foundation and Legal Framework:

**First Amendment Violations:**
- **Protected Speech**: The Supreme Court in *Gertz v. Robert Welch* (1974) established that speech concerning matters of public concern receives heightened protection. Warnings about business fraud and wage theft directly serve the public interest by protecting potential victims and maintaining marketplace integrity.
- **Content-Based Restriction**: The coordinated harassment specifically targeted the victim's fraud-related speech, constituting impermissible content-based censorship
- **Chilling Effect**: *New York Times v. Sullivan* (1964) prohibits government action that chills protected speech; private conspiracy to achieve same result violates § 241
- **Economic Speech Protection**: *NAACP v. Claiborne Hardware* (1982) protects economic speech that serves public interest

**Due Process Violations (14th Amendment):**
- **Procedural Due Process**: Intimidation designed to prevent access to legal system and law enforcement reporting
- **Substantive Due Process**: Coordinated harassment violates fundamental liberty interests in free speech and personal security

**Federal Jurisdiction Constitutional Foundation:**
The interstate coordination to deprive constitutional rights provides probable cause for federal jurisdiction under the Commerce Clause and 14th Amendment enforcement provisions.

## FEDERAL DISABILITY RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (42 U.S.C. § 12132)

### AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT TITLE II VIOLATIONS

**Statutory Requirements Under Federal Law:**

- **MUST** make reasonable modifications to avoid discrimination
- **MUST** distinguish disability-related behaviors from criminal conduct
- **CANNOT** criminalize actions resulting from disability
- **MUST** provide equal access to services and programs

### AUTISM-RELATED BEHAVIORS DISCRIMINATORILY MISCHARACTERIZED

**Complainant's Documented Autism-Related Behaviors:**
- **Mirroring Communication Technique:** Well-documented autism coping mechanism used to demonstrate the social inappropriateness of the harasser's behavior - autism research confirms individuals with ASD use mirroring to navigate social situations, process information, and help others understand inappropriate conduct
- **Direct Communication Style:** Autism-related straightforward response patterns typical of neurological differences
- **Systematic Analysis Approach:** Detail-oriented logical thinking characteristic of autism spectrum disorder
- **Evidence-Based Documentation:** Autism-related focus on comprehensive record-keeping and factual accuracy

**Pataskala Police Department ADA Violations:**
1. **Mischaracterized appropriate defensive autism behaviors as "aggressive" conduct**
2. **Failed to recognize mirroring technique as documented autism communication strategy**
3. **Applied neurotypical behavioral expectations without disability accommodation**
4. **Used disability-related responses against complainant to dismiss legitimate complaint**
5. **Denied equal access to police services based on neurological differences**

2. **Behavioral Accommodation:** Understanding mirroring as documented autism technique to demonstrate others' inappropriate behavior
3. **Procedural Accommodation:** Allowing systematic, evidence-based case presentation typical of autism cognitive processing
4. **Equal Investigation Standards:** Identical police services regardless of neurological differences

**Federal ADA Enforcement Actions Required:**
- **DOJ Civil Rights Division investigation** of systematic disability discrimination

## FACTUAL BASIS FOR COMPLAINT

### Comprehensive Timeline of Criminal Conduct:

**DETAILED TIMELINE REFERENCE:** Complete chronological documentation with coordination analysis, escalation patterns, and requested investigation priorities the following referenced attachment, or click: **[Comprehensive Timeline of Criminal Conduct](comprehensive_timeline_criminal_conduct.md)**

**KEY TIMELINE SUMMARY:**
- **July 15, 2025 (11:01 AM & 12:23 PM):** Victim posts protected speech about wage theft to David Poindexter's Facebook timeline
- **July 16, 2025:** Shaun Strange (NC resident) sends Facebook friend request within 24 hours
- **July 17, 2025:** Victim accepts friend request, unaware of connection to David
- **July 18, 2025 (11:55 AM):** Shaun initiates nearly 10 hours harassment campaign (~9h 41min) with detailed knowledge suggesting coordination
- **July 18, 2025 (1:53 PM):** Victim warns David about sending harassers
- **July 18, 2025 (2:38 PM):** **CRITICAL 45-MINUTE COORDINATION WINDOW** - Harassment escalates immediately after warning
- **July 18, 2025 (9:18 PM):** Explicit threats of armed violence ("feel froggy")
- **July 18, 2025 (Late Evening):** Evidence destruction through strategic blocking
- **July 19, 2025:** Medical impact manifests with stress-induced gout attack 

## COORDINATION SPECULATION: HARASSMENT ESCALATION ANALYSIS

### Before Warning David (July 18, 2025 - 11:55 AM to 1:53 PM):
**Shaun's messaging pattern:** Hostile but somewhat restrained
- 11:55 AM: "you not allowing yourself to appear to be very brilliant here"

### CRITICAL INTERVENTION (July 18, 2025 - 1:53 PM):
**Victim warns David:** "If you are sending your boys after me to attack and harass me isn't very smart on your end..."

### After Warning David (July 18, 2025 - 2:38 PM onward):
**Immediate escalation in aggression and specificity:**
- 2:38 PM: "**Shoot over the address bud. Or even just a phone number would be good 😂😂😂**" (more demanding, mocking tone)
- 8:16 PM: Harassment continues with increased intensity
- 9:18 PM: "**I'm giving you the chance to feel froggy**" (explicit armed violence invitation)

### COORDINATION EVIDENCE:
**Timeline Analysis:** Harassment escalated in both tone and specificity within 45 minutes of warning David. These patterns are consistent with coordination scenarios, including:
1. Possible contact between David and Shaun after receiving the warning
2. Potential tactical instruction or reassurance
3. The 45-minute gap may represent consultation time between co-conspirators
*Investigation is needed to confirm the nature and extent of any coordination.*

**Legal Significance:** This timeline strongly suggests ongoing coordination during the harassment campaign, indicating active conspiracy rather than random harassment.

### Interstate Nature & Local Connections - CRITICAL THREAT ESCALATION:
- Suspect resides in Iredell County, North Carolina
- Victim resides in Licking County, Ohio  
- All communications crossed state lines via Facebook's interstate servers
- **CRITICAL: Suspect's LinkedIn profile shows employment history in Ohio**
- **INFERENCE:** Suspect likely selected specifically for Ohio connections and local knowledge
- **INFERENCE:** This suggests premeditated coordination rather than random harassment
- Physical distance combined with local familiarity creates heightened threat level
- **Address remains vulnerable** due to suspect's Ohio professional/personal networks
- Suspects live only 8 hours driving distance away and has shown clear violent and irrational tendencies
- People search sites are readily affordable and can provide my address

**Enhanced Federal Jurisdiction Analysis:**
- Communications crossed state lines via Facebook's interstate servers and internet infrastructure
- Conspiracy spans multiple states (NC-OH) with coordinated criminal activity
- Business interests affected operate in interstate commerce through digital platforms
- Pattern threatens interstate business community confidence and marketplace integrity
- Suspect's Ohio connections create ongoing interstate threat capability and surveillance network
- Electronic commerce and digital business operations create federal commerce nexus
- Interstate nature of harassment campaign affects federal interest in protecting business fraud witnesses
- Cross-state coordination demonstrates sophisticated criminal enterprise requiring federal oversight

**CRITICAL CONSPIRACY ELEMENT - DAVID'S SILENCE AS ACTIVE PARTICIPATION:**

David Poindexter's deliberate silence in response to these public posts constitutes active participation in the intimidation conspiracy under established legal principles. His calculated non-response serves multiple criminal purposes:

**1. Acquiescence Under Law:** Silence in the face of public accusations, when combined with coordinated private harassment, constitutes legal acquiescence and admission. Under established precedent, failure to respond to serious public allegations while simultaneously orchestrating intimidation demonstrates consciousness of guilt.

**2. Perpetuation of Terror:** David's silence is not passive - it is a strategic choice designed to maximize the psychological impact of Shaun's harassment. By remaining publicly silent while privately coordinating intimidation, David:
- **Amplifies the threatening effect** of Shaun's demands and violence threats
- **Creates additional fear** that more harassment operatives may emerge without warning
- **Maintains plausible deniability** while ensuring the intimidation continues
- **Demonstrates that the harassment is achieving its intended silencing effect**

**3. Strategic Intimidation Enhancement:** David's silence serves as a force multiplier for Shaun's threats by:
- **Confirming the effectiveness** of the harassment campaign
- **Signaling to me that resistance is futile** and will only bring more harassment
- **Creating uncertainty** about how many other associates may be deployed
- **Maximizing psychological terror** through the unknown scope of the conspiracy

**4. Conscious Criminal Coordination:** No innocent person accused of wage theft would remain silent while a stranger spontaneously launches a 10-hour harassment campaign on their behalf. David's silence indicates:
- **Prior coordination** with Shaun about the harassment strategy
- **Ongoing monitoring** of the harassment effectiveness
- **Deliberate choice** to let intimidation continue rather than stop it
- **Active participation** in conspiracy through strategic non-action

**5. Legal Precedent for Silence as Criminal Act:** Under conspiracy law, silence combined with benefit from others' criminal acts constitutes active participation. David's silence while benefiting from harassment designed to silence my protected speech makes him an active co-conspirator, not a passive beneficiary.

This pattern of public silence combined with private intimidation coordination represents one of the most disturbing aspects of this conspiracy - the calculated use of silence as a weapon of terror and psychological manipulation.

## ENHANCED CONSPIRACY EVIDENCE - STRATEGIC TARGETING OF KNOWN VULNERABILITIES

### DAVID'S DOCUMENTED KNOWLEDGE OF COMPLAINANT'S PATTERNS

**Established Professional Relationship:**
- **Duration:** Multiple years of close professional collaboration
- **Working Relationship:** Extended business partnership requiring detailed personal interaction
- **Observable Patterns:** Any colleague working closely for years would necessarily observe communication styles, behavioral patterns, and response tendencies

**Autism-Related Patterns David Would Have Observed:**
- **Communication Style:** Direct, systematic, evidence-based approach to problem-solving
- **Documentation Habits:** Comprehensive record-keeping and factual accuracy focus
- **Professional Boundaries:** Clear distinction between cooperation and submission to exploitation
- **Stress Responses:** Predictable patterns when confronted with intimidation tactics

### STRATEGIC HARASSMENT DESIGN - ENHANCED PROBABLE CAUSE

**Evidence of Coordinated Targeting:**
1. **Harassment Timing:** Campaign initiated immediately following victim's public wage theft complaints
2. **Tactical Selection:** Shaun specifically chosen for characteristics that would maximize intimidation effectiveness
3. **Behavioral Exploitation:** Harassment appears designed around David's years of observing victim's response patterns
4. **Escalation Strategy:** When victim's defensive responses occurred, harassment immediately intensified

**Enhanced Federal Conspiracy Probable Cause (18 U.S.C. § 371):**
- **Agreement:** David's intimate knowledge of victim's patterns combined with precisely targeted harassment suggests premeditated coordination
- **Overt Acts:** Shaun's harassment campaign potentially designed around David's years of behavioral observations
- **Criminal Purpose:** Interstate harassment conspiracy targeting individual with known autism-related characteristics

**Enhanced Federal Disability Rights Violations:**
- **Professional Exploitation:** Years of business relationship potentially exploited to identify and target disability-related vulnerabilities
- **Strategic Discrimination:** Harassment potentially calculated to trigger known autism responses that would be mischaracterized by law enforcement
- **Premeditated ADA Violations:** Possible deliberate use of observed autism-related patterns to undermine victim's credibility

This intelligence significantly strengthens probable cause by demonstrating the harassment may have been sophisticated, premeditated conspiracy specifically designed to exploit disability-related characteristics observed over years of professional collaboration.

### Pattern of Criminal Behavior:
1. **Initiation:** Unprovoked attack on legally protected speech
2. **Escalation:** Personal insults and character assassination
3. **Demands:** Repeated requests for personal identifying information
4. **Threats:** Implicit and explicit threats of physical violence
5. **Persistence:** Continued harassment despite clear rejection
6. **Coordination:** Evidence of planning and consultation with associates

## DETAILED CONSPIRACY COORDINATION EVIDENCE

### Timeline-Based Coordination Proof:

**Critical Timeline Establishing Nearly Impossible Coincidence:**
1. **July 15, 2025 (11:01 AM):** Victim posts wage theft complaint to David's Facebook timeline
2. **July 15, 2025 (12:23 PM):** Victim makes second post to David's timeline  
3. **July 16, 2025:** Shaun Strange (complete stranger) sends Facebook friend request within 24 hours
4. **July 18, 2025 (11:55 AM):** Harassment begins with intimate knowledge of dispute details

**Impossibility of Random Contact Analysis:**
- **No Prior Relationship:** No evidence of previous contact between Shaun and victim
- **Intimate Knowledge:** Shaun possessed detailed understanding of wage theft dispute
- **Strategic Timing:** Contact initiated within 24 hours of public wage theft posts
- **Tactical Sophistication:** Professional-level harassment campaign design
- **Geographic Selection:** Suspect specifically chosen for Ohio connections

## COORDINATED ATTACK PATTERN ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL PATTERN:** Shaun's harassment directly references my "publicly posting things" about David, confirming the coordinated nature of the attack. Shaun specifically targeted my posts warning others about David's wage theft, demonstrating the conspiracy to silence protected speech.

**KEY CONSPIRACY EVIDENCE - SHAUN'S DIRECT QUOTES:**

**Targeting Protected Speech:**
- "I saw your comment you are making yourself look own self look like a fool with the way that you are **publicly posting things**"
- "I'm trying to tell you that you are **publicly making yourself look like a fool**, that can't be good for your business"
- "you are making yourself look like a raging lunatic the way you are **publicly commenting**"

**Escalating Demands for Personal Information:**
- "if your going to ballsy enough to send me a threat from behind a computer screen then be ballsy enough to **send your address** along with said threats"
- "**Shoot over the address** bud. Or even just **a phone number** would be good 😂😂😂"
- "I'm **giving you the chance** to feel froggy"

**Coordinated Timing Evidence:**
- Message at 2:38 PM came **AFTER** my 1:53 PM post to David warning about sending harassers
- **CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE:** Escalated aggression after David contact suggests coordination
- **INVESTIGATION NEEDED:** David may have contacted Shaun between 1:53 PM and 2:38 PM based on timing

**Destruction of Evidence:**
- Shaun blocked me immediately after threats, preventing access to conversation history
- Facebook warns users that blocking removes evidence - this was intentional evidence destruction
- **INVESTIGATION NEEDED:** More incriminating evidence may be available that I can no longer access 

These quotes and patterns strongly indicate coordinated conspiracy to silence First Amendment-protected warnings about David's wage theft through interstate stalking and intimidation.
- Documentation of suspect's Ohio connections creating enhanced threat
- Evidence of shared objectives and coordinated tactics
- Pattern analysis suggesting premeditation rather than random contact

**6. Victim Impact Documentation:**
- Records of emotional distress caused to family
- Documentation of security measures required due to threats
- Evidence of chilling effect on protected speech
- **Medical documentation of stress-induced health effects**

- Please reference attachment, or click: [Medical documentation of stress-induced health effects](medical_documentation_of_stress-induced_health_effects.md)

- **Stress-induced first gout attack** with excruciating pain and mobility limitations
- **Dermatological stress response** with hives outbreak on right arm correlating directly with harassment timeline
- **Documented correlation** between harassment escalation and immediate physical health deterioration

All evidence clearly establishes the interstate nature of this stalking and harassment campaign, the threatening nature of the communications, the suspected conspiracy elements, and the substantial emotional distress caused to myself and my family.

## COMPREHENSIVE VICTIM IMPACT STATEMENT

This sustained harassment campaign has caused substantial emotional distress and **immediate physical health consequences** to myself and my family. The discovery that this was likely a coordinated conspiracy rather than random harassment has significantly intensified the psychological impact and fear for our safety.

**CRITICAL MEDICAL IMPACT - EVIDENCE OF SEVERE HARASSMENT EFFECTS:**
During the height of the harassment campaign, I experienced my **first-ever gout attack**, causing excruciating pain and significant mobility limitations. This stress-induced medical emergency occurred directly during the peak harassment period and required several days of recovery before I was physically capable of preparing this comprehensive legal documentation.

Additionally, I developed **stress-related hives on my right arm** that appeared in direct correlation with the harassment timeline. These physical manifestations of stress demonstrate the severe psychological impact this coordinated intimidation campaign has had on my health and well-being.

**Firearm Threat Impact:**
The suspect's explicit invitation to "feel froggy" (street slang for armed confrontation) combined with repeated demands for my home address creates an **immediate threat of armed violence** that requires emergency firearm removal from both suspects. The knowledge that I own firearms for sport shooting and self-defense, combined with the suspect's demands for my address, raises serious concerns about intention to **plan an armed confrontation at my family home**. This creates an imminent danger requiring immediate firearm prohibition and removal procedures.

**Enhanced Family Safety Protocols:**
My wife is now armed (Ruger LCP II) and has been instructed on defensive protocols. **This situation should never have escalated to the point where my family requires armed self-defense preparation**. My wife does not like having to carry a firearm at all and this is giving her additional anxiety. 

**URGENT FIREARM REMOVAL REQUIRED:** The fact that my family has been forced into armed defensive posture demonstrates the immediate need for **comprehensive firearm removal from both suspects** to prevent armed confrontation. The emotional trauma of having to prepare my wife for potential deadly force scenarios could be alleviated by immediate removal of firearms from the threatening parties.

**Conspiracy Impact - Enhanced Threat Assessment:**
Discovery that this harassment was likely coordinated has created several additional layers of fear and concern:

- **Multiple Actor Threat:** Realization that multiple individuals are working together to harm my family creates enhanced fear
- **Resource Coordination:** Understanding that this involves business interests and financial resources suggests a sustained, well-funded threat
- **Intelligence Network:** Fear that the conspiracy involves ongoing surveillance and information gathering about my family's activities and location
- **Escalation Potential:** Coordinated efforts suggest this may not be a one-time incident but part of an ongoing campaign

**Ohio Connections - Critical Vulnerability:**
**HEIGHTENED THREAT LEVEL:** Discovery that the suspect has Ohio employment history on his LinkedIn profile significantly escalates the threat assessment. This indicates:

- **Possible Premeditated Selection:** The suspect's Ohio connections may indicate deliberate selection, though this requires investigation
- **Local Intelligence Capability:** May have current contacts who could provide address information through social engineering, professional networks, or public records searches
- **Familiarity with Area:** Unlike a random out-of-state harasser, suspect knows Ohio geography and could easily locate me
- **Ongoing Surveillance Risk:** Ohio connections may be unknowingly providing current information about my activities, schedule, and family movements

**MY ADDRESS REMAINS ACTIVELY VULNERABLE** - The suspect's Ohio employment history means he likely has current contacts in the state who could provide my address through social engineering, professional networks, or public records searches. This creates an immediate and ongoing threat requiring urgent law enforcement intervention.

**Business Retaliation Impact - Critical Chilling Effect on Protected Speech:**
The timing and apparent coordination of this harassment, immediately following my attempts to warn business owners about David's theft, combined with the suspect's Ohio connections, strongly suggests this is part of a carefully planned conspiracy to silence my legally protected speech about wage theft.

**DOCUMENTED SUPPRESSION OF CONSUMER PROTECTION EFFORTS:**
At the time this harassment campaign began, I was actively developing "nvisionativesucks.com" - a consumer warning website to document David Poindexter's pattern of wage theft and business fraud. **This legitimate consumer protection project has been completely halted** due to the coordinated intimidation campaign, representing a successful achievement of the suspects' criminal objective.

**Quantifiable Economic Harm from Chilling Effect:**
- **Direct Business Disruption:** Complete cessation of nvisionativesucks.com development project
- **Lost Revenue Opportunities:** The warning website could have generated revenue through advertising, affiliate marketing, or consulting services
- **Professional Reputation Damage:** My ability to engage in legitimate business criticism is compromised, affecting future business opportunities requiring public-facing advocacy
- **Forced Security/Legal Costs:** Resources diverted from productive work to defensive measures, legal consultation, and comprehensive documentation efforts
- **Market Information Suppression:** Consumers lack critical information needed for informed business decisions about David's business practices, creating market inefficiency that enables continued victimization

**Constitutional Rights Violations:**
- **First Amendment Suppression:** The intimidation tactics directly suppress my right to warn others about business misconduct, constituting successful censorship through criminal means
- **Protected Commercial Speech:** Consumer warnings about business fraud receive heightened First Amendment protection as speech serving clear public interest
- **Ongoing Fear:** I cannot resume legitimate business criticism activities due to fear of escalated harassment and potential violence
- **Successful Criminal Objective:** The harassment has achieved its intended goal of silencing protected speech about business crimes

**Broader Impact on Business Fraud Prevention:**
- **Chilling Effect on Other Critics:** Fear that speaking out about business fraud will result in coordinated harassment campaigns
- **Professional Retaliation Systems:** Evidence of systematic damage to business reputation through coordinated attacks
- **Other Victim Protection Compromised:** This intimidation prevents me from warning other potential victims of David's business practices
- **Legal System Integrity Threatened:** Coordinated harassment campaigns can successfully silence witnesses to business crimes, undermining law enforcement efforts

**Immediate Physical Health Impact:**
- **Stress-Induced Gout Attack:** Developed first-ever gout attack during height of harassment, causing excruciating pain and mobility limitations
- **Stress-Related Dermatitis:** Broke out in hives on right arm directly correlating with harassment timeline
- **Physical Incapacitation:** Required significant recovery time before being physically capable of preparing comprehensive legal documentation
- **Ongoing Pain Management:** Current mobility limitations requiring pain endurance strategies for basic activities like grocery shopping

**Ongoing Psychological Impact:**
- **Hypervigilance:** Constantly monitoring for signs of surveillance or approach by suspects or associates
- **Sleep Disruption:** Difficulty sleeping due to concerns about home security and family safety
- **Professional Impact:** Difficulty concentrating on work due to ongoing threat concerns
- **Social Isolation:** Reluctance to engage in normal social activities due to security concerns
- **Medical Stress Compounding:** Fear that continued harassment will trigger additional stress-related health episodes

**Long-term Security Concerns:**
Given the conspiracy elements and business interests involved, this appears to be more than a temporary harassment incident. The coordinated nature suggests:

- **Sustained Threat:** This may be an ongoing campaign rather than a one-time incident
- **Resource Availability:** Business interests provide funding and motivation for continued harassment
- **Network Effects:** Other associates may be recruited for future intimidation efforts
- **Escalation Risk:** Failed intimidation may lead to more aggressive tactics
- **Health Vulnerability:** Continued harassment may trigger additional stress-related medical episodes, potentially creating life-threatening health complications

**Medical Evidence Supporting Criminal Severity:**
The immediate onset of stress-induced gout (a condition I had never experienced) and dermatological stress reactions during the harassment demonstrates the severe psychological trauma inflicted by this coordinated intimidation campaign. These physical manifestations provide objective medical evidence of the criminal impact and serious bodily harm caused through psychological terrorism.

**Community and Societal Impact:**
This coordinated harassment campaign extends beyond personal harm to threaten broader community interests:

- **Chilling Effect on Other Business Fraud Witnesses:** Other victims of wage theft may be discouraged from reporting crimes or warning the business community
- **Threat to Marketplace Integrity:** Systematic intimidation of those reporting business fraud undermines consumer protection and fair business practices
- **Undermining Legal System Effectiveness:** When witnesses are successfully intimidated into silence, it impairs law enforcement's ability to investigate and prosecute business crimes
- **Small Business Community Impact:** Creates fear among small business owners and contractors about reporting wage theft and business fraud
- **Constitutional Rights Violation:** Coordinated campaigns to silence First Amendment protected speech threaten fundamental democratic principles
- **Potential for Replication:** Success of this intimidation campaign may encourage similar attacks against other fraud victims and whistleblowers

The interstate nature combined with local connections makes standard protective measures insufficient, as the suspects have both the motivation and capability to locate and approach my family. The sophisticated coordination suggests this requires federal-level investigation and protection to prevent both immediate harm and broader societal damage.

## SUSPECT INFORMATION

### Primary Suspect - Shaun Strange:

**Name:** Shaun Strange (as indicated on Facebook profile)
**Current Location:** Iredell County, North Carolina (Facebook profile location)
**Likely Residence:** Mooresville, North Carolina area (based on county location)
**Social Media:** Please reference attachment, or click:
- [Links to Shaun Strange's Facebook profile showing North Carolina location](links_to_shaun_stranges_facebook_profile_showing_north_carolina_location.md),
- [Links to Shaun Strange's LinkedIn profile showing North Carolina and Ohio locations](links_to_shaun_stranges_linkedin_profile_showing_north_carolina_and_ohio_locations.md),  

, and ALL other social media accounts requiring investigation  

**Professional Profile:** LinkedIn shows employment history in Ohio (CRITICAL THREAT INTELLIGENCE)
**Method of Contact:** Facebook Messenger harassment campaign
**Criminal History:** Unknown - requesting law enforcement background check

**Prior Interaction Evidence:** I have clear recollection, though no preserved evidence, that Shaun Strange aggressively defended David Poindexter on LinkedIn after I made a collections attempt and conveyed how much the unpaid funds would help my family. This prior defensive behavior indicates:

- **Possible preexisting relationship** between Shaun and David requiring investigation
- **Pattern of aggressive defense** of David's business interests
- **Knowledge of my family's financial hardship** that he rejoices in to inflict emotional damage
- **Established history of hostility** toward my legitimate wage claims
- **Proven willingness to attack** those seeking payment from David

**Escalated Deception and Threat Assessment:** If confirmed, Shaun's current claims of not knowing David or the situation would be demonstrably false based on this prior LinkedIn interaction. His deliberate lies about their connection, combined with his knowledge that I am aware of his deception, significantly escalates the threatening nature of his communications. This pattern shows:

- **Calculated deception** about relationship with David
- **Willingness to lie under threatening circumstances**
- **Escalated intimidation** when confronted with truth
- **Consciousness of guilt** regarding coordination with David

**THREAT ASSESSMENT:** Ohio employment history indicates local knowledge and potential ongoing surveillance capabilities. Suspect was likely selected specifically for these Ohio connections, making him operationally effective in victim's geographic area. When confronted with these fears he only doubled down. When rhetorically asked for him to give his address first to make clear just how threatening that was he doubled down on the threatening behavior.

### Suspected Co-conspirator - David Poindexter:

**Name:** David Poindexter
**Title:** CEO, nvisonative.com
**Business Location:** Iredell County, North Carolina (same county as Shaun Strange)
**Likely Residence:** Mooresville, North Carolina area (same city as suspected harasser)
**GEOGRAPHIC SIGNIFICANCE:** The fact that both suspects operate in the same county and likely the same city creates strong presumption of regular contact and coordination capability
**Relationship to Victim:** Former business associate who owes unpaid wages
**Motive:** Victim's public warnings about wage theft threaten his business relationships and reputation
**Pattern of Involvement:** **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED** - Suspect coordination and direction of harassment campaign evidenced by timing and tactical approach
**Method of Involvement:** **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED** - Communication method and coordination with Shaun Strange unknown but evidenced by harassment timing

**Known Associates:** 
- Shaun Strange (confirmed through harassment coordination)
- Ansel Brown (business partner and bad country music artist)

**Business Network:** **INVESTIGATION REQUIRED** - Unknown extent of associates and potential co-conspirators requiring comprehensive investigation

## CONCLUSION

This criminal complaint documents a sophisticated interstate stalking and harassment conspiracy designed to silence legally protected speech about business fraud. The explicit threats of armed violence, combined with evidence of coordination and the suspects' capability to locate and harm my family, creates an immediate danger requiring comprehensive federal and state law enforcement intervention.

The medical evidence of stress-induced gout and dermatological reactions provides objective proof of the serious bodily harm caused by this psychological terrorism campaign. The interstate nature, conspiracy elements, and firearm threat implications clearly establish federal jurisdiction and the need for immediate, comprehensive action to protect my family and preserve the integrity of our legal system.

I respectfully request that law enforcement treat this as a high-priority case requiring immediate action, given the documented threats, medical harm, interstate nature, and evidence of ongoing criminal conspiracy. The sophisticated coordination and business interests involved suggest this represents a significant threat not only to my family but to the broader principle that victims of business fraud should be able to speak publicly without fear of coordinated retaliation campaigns.

## WHAT I REALLY WANT

I just want this to end peacefully. If Shaun apologizes and explains why he did this, I'm willing to resolve this. But I need to know:

1. **Who else was involved?** I suspect David Ponidexter may have put him up to this
2. **Will he leave me alone?** I need his promise that he won't retaliate against me or my website nvisionativesucks.com that exposes David's CEO misconduct

**Important:** I never intended any violence whatsoever. I take great offense at any suggestion otherwise. My responses were defensive - showing him how inappropriate his behavior was by mirroring it back. This response came from fear, not aggression.

**Personal Statement:** I know what is in my heart. My entire life people dismiss me, feel like they know my intent, and attack me for my differences and my refusal to lay down and go away when wronged. When it comes to the safety of my family, I will not allow crude behaviors to continue - I will do all I can within legal bounds to protect them.

**Clarification on Misinterpretation:** If any of my posts or actions have been misconstrued as threatening when they were innocent acts, I am willing to discuss any such interpretations and apologize for my actions causing fear due to mischaracterization.

**The Problem:** Police discrimination prevents proper investigation, necessitating federal intervention to achieve justice. While the harassment incident has observably paused, the effects persist and accountability is required to prevent future incidents.

**Law Enforcement Connection Concerns:** The unexpected dismissive police response makes me believe this individual may be law enforcement as well, enhancing my fears even more. His undisclosed current employment on his LinkedIn heightens this possibility.

**IMMEDIATE FIREARM REMOVAL FROM BOTH SUSPECTS IS THE TOP PRIORITY** to prevent the armed confrontation that the harasser explicitly invited and the conspiracy appears designed to provoke.
