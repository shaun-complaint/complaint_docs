## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

I am respectfully reporting concerns about potential civil rights violations by the Pataskala Police Department under 18 U.S.C. § 242 (Deprivation of Rights Under Color of Law). This complaint documents what appears to be violations of constitutional rights through:

1. **Concerns about unequal treatment** based on disability status (autism)
2. **Possible pattern of different treatment** for connected individuals versus other victims  
3. **Insufficient investigation** of Ohio state crimes within their jurisdiction
4. **Interstate jurisdiction** necessitating FBI intervention
5. **Local jurisdiction limitations** - Licking County Sheriff's Office declined to accept this complaint, referring jurisdiction to Pataskala Police Department, which has demonstrated bias

## PRIMARY FEDERAL CRIMES

### 18 U.S.C. § 242 - DEPRIVATION OF RIGHTS UNDER COLOR OF LAW

**Elements Present:**
- **Acting under color of law:** Pataskala Police Department officers
- **Willful deprivation:** Knowing violation of clearly established rights  
- **Constitutional rights:** 14th Amendment Equal Protection, ADA rights
- **Specific intent:** Deliberate discrimination based on disability and connections

### 18 U.S.C. § 2261A - INTERSTATE STALKING (Underlying Crime Police Refuse to Investigate)

**Elements Present:**
- **Interstate commerce:** North Carolina suspects harassing Ohio victim
- **Course of conduct:** Pattern of harassment and threats
- **Intent to harass/intimidate:** Documented threats and demands for home address
- **Reasonable fear:** Medical evidence of trauma, security measures taken

## CRIMINAL CIVIL RIGHTS VIOLATIONS

### INCIDENT 1: VIOLENT ASSAULT COVER-UP
**Date:** [Previous incident]  
**Constitutional Violation:** Equal Protection Clause (14th Amendment)

**Criminal Conduct by Police:**
- **Willful failure to investigate** violent assault when perpetrator's brother is police officer
- **Discriminatory enforcement:** Protected connected individual, denied victim equal justice
- **Conspiracy elements:** Coordinated effort to avoid prosecution of officer's family member
- **Color of law violation:** Used police authority to obstruct justice
- **Victim Impact:** Their failure caused such terror I moved to Louisiana to escape abuse without protection. I developed serious PTSD. It took extraordinary strength to seek help from the very same department that had failed me - returning to the department that chose favoritism over my safety

### INCIDENT 2: DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION  
**Date:** July 2025  
**Constitutional Violation:** ADA Title II, Equal Protection Clause

**Criminal Conduct by Police:**
- **Willful ADA violation:** Discriminated against autism-related defensive behaviors
- **Deliberate indifference:** Ignored clearly established disability accommodation requirements
- **Discriminatory investigation:** Applied different standards based on disability characteristics  
- **Federal crime facilitation:** Refused to investigate interstate stalking, failing to hold perpetrators accountable

## DISABILITY DISCRIMINATION ELEMENTS

### CLEARLY ESTABLISHED ADA RIGHTS VIOLATED

**42 U.S.C. § 12132 - Title II Requirements:**
- Public entities cannot discriminate based on disability
- Must make reasonable accommodations for disability-related behaviors
- Cannot criminalize actions resulting from disability
- Must provide equal access to services (police protection)

### AUTISM-RELATED BEHAVIORS CRIMINALIZED

**Police Mischaracterization:**
1. **Mirroring Communication:** Interpreted well-documented autism coping mechanism as "aggression" - individuals with ASD use mirroring to navigate social situations, process information, and manage anxiety
2. **Direct Communication:** Labeled straightforward autism responses as "threatening"  
3. **Defensive Responses:** Claimed disability-related reactions showed "no fear"
4. **Systematic Thinking:** Dismissed logical, evidence-based presentations
5. **Objective Review Failure:** Officer twisted my analysis section labeled "REFUSAL TO ENGAGE:" (describing perpetrator's refusal to engage honestly) into false claim that I wanted engagement to continue - any reasonable reading shows I was analyzing harasser's dishonest behavior, not expressing desire for continued harassment

**Discriminatory Pattern:**
- Officers **knew or should have known** these were disability-related behaviors
- **Applied different standards** than would be used for neurotypical victims
- **Demonstrated palpable bias** from start of interaction - approach suggested goal was to end engagement rather than investigate
- **Used autism communication differences** against victim to justify denial of service

## INTERSTATE NEXUS REQUIRING FBI JURISDICTION

### LOCAL POLICE CORRUPTION/BIAS
- **Connected individual protection:** Pattern of shielding officer family members
- **Disability discrimination:** Systematic violation of federal ADA requirements
- **Federal crime facilitation:** Refused to investigate interstate stalking

### INTERSTATE CRIMES IGNORED
- **18 U.S.C. § 2261A:** Interstate stalking and harassment
- **18 U.S.C. § 875(c):** Interstate communication of threats
- **Conspiracy elements:** Coordination between North Carolina suspects

## WILLFUL INTENT EVIDENCE

### CONSCIOUS DISREGARD OF ESTABLISHED LAW
1. **ADA knowledge:** Police departments receive disability rights training
2. **Equal protection awareness:** Basic constitutional principle in law enforcement
3. **Federal crime recognition:** Interstate stalking clearly within federal jurisdiction
4. **Deliberate choice:** Conscious decision to discriminate and refuse investigation

### PATTERN OF WILLFUL VIOLATIONS
- **Multiple incidents:** Shows systematic rather than isolated misconduct
- **Consistent discrimination:** Same biased approach across different cases
- **Escalating violations:** Increased boldness in violating federal rights

## REQUESTED FBI ACTION

### CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
1. **18 U.S.C. § 242 charges** against involved Pataskala police officers
2. **18 U.S.C. § 241 conspiracy charges** if coordination proven
3. **Federal prosecution** for willful civil rights violations

### INTERSTATE CRIME INVESTIGATION  
1. **18 U.S.C. § 2261A investigation** of North Carolina suspects
2. **Interstate coordination** with North Carolina law enforcement
3. **Federal charges** against harassment perpetrators

### CIVIL RIGHTS ENFORCEMENT
1. **Pattern/practice investigation** referral to DOJ Civil Rights Division
2. **Federal monitoring** of Pataskala Police Department
3. **Consent decree** requirements for constitutional compliance

## IMMEDIATE DANGER TO CIVIL RIGHTS

### ONGOING VIOLATIONS
- **Continued harassment:** Perpetrators emboldened by police inaction
- **Civil rights denial:** Pattern affecting other disability community members
- **Federal crime facilitation:** Police refusal enables interstate criminal activity

### COMMUNITY IMPACT  
- **Disabled individuals:** Cannot rely on equal police protection
- **Crime victims:** Unequal justice based on connections/characteristics
- **Federal law enforcement:** Local bias necessitates federal intervention

    - Written reports, notes, and internal memos
    - All electronic records, logs, and databases entries regarding my case
  - **Informational timeframes** (believed complainant presence - preservation NOT limited to these hours):
    - July 28, 2025 ~3:00-5:30 PM and July 29, 2025 1:45-2:15 PM

## FEDERAL JURISDICTION BASIS

**Interstate Commerce:** Crimes crossed state lines requiring federal investigation  
**Civil Rights Enforcement:** Local corruption necessitates federal oversight  
**Constitutional Violations:** Willful deprivation of federal rights under color of law  
**Disability Rights:** Federal ADA enforcement authority  
**Law Enforcement Connection:** Suspect's undisclosed current employment on LinkedIn and police department's unusual dismissive response raises concerns of law enforcement background, requiring independent federal investigation

## CONCLUSION

The Pataskala Police Department has engaged in **criminal civil rights violations** under 18 U.S.C. § 242 through willful discrimination based on disability status and systematic protection of connected individuals. This pattern of misconduct facilitates ongoing federal crimes and denies equal protection under law.

**FBI investigation is essential** because:
- Local police corruption prevents proper investigation
- Interstate crimes require federal jurisdiction and resources  
- Constitutional rights violations demand federal enforcement
- Pattern of discrimination threatens broader civil rights

## WHAT I REALLY WANT

I just want this to end peacefully. If Shaun apologizes and explains why he did this, I'm willing to resolve this. But I need to know:

1. **Who else was involved?** I suspect David Ponidexter may have put him up to this
2. **Will he leave me alone?** I need his promise that he won't retaliate against me or my website nvisionativesucks.com that exposes David's CEO misconduct

**Important:** I never intended any violence whatsoever. I take great offense at any suggestion otherwise. My responses were defensive - showing him how inappropriate his behavior was by mirroring it back. This response came from fear, not aggression.

**Personal Statement on Autism Discrimination:** I know what is in my heart. My entire life I have suffered discrimination and ill will due to my autism - reactions to my approach to communicating, assumptions of ill intent, and attacks when people feel threatened because I ask questions I am genuinely curious about but which expose ignorance and embarrass others. I have little social awareness of many of my actions and have suffered greatly in my life due to lack of understanding around how I communicate. The police department is perpetuating this lifelong pattern of autism discrimination.

**Seeking Medical Documentation:** I am currently working through Ohio's disability services system to obtain formal autism diagnosis and documentation. My autism-related communication differences include direct questioning, literal interpretation, and difficulty reading social cues - all of which are well-documented, common characteristics of autism spectrum disorder according to medical literature and autism research organizations.

**ADA Legal Protections:** Under 42 U.S.C. § 12132 (ADA Title II), public entities cannot discriminate based on disability and must make reasonable accommodations. My autism-related communication patterns deserve protection, yet the police department has violated these legal requirements by using my disability-related behaviors against me to dismiss my complaint and deny equal protection.

**Clarification on Misinterpretation:** If any of my posts or actions have been misconstrued as threatening when they were innocent acts, I am willing to discuss any such interpretations and apologize for my actions causing fear due to mischaracterization.

**The Problem:** Police discrimination prevents proper investigation, necessitating federal intervention to achieve justice. While the harassment incident has observably paused, the effects persist and accountability is required to prevent future incidents.

**URGENT:** Ongoing civil rights violations and facilitation of interstate crimes create immediate danger requiring federal intervention.
